## CheckList

Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, [Ribeiro et al (2020)](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf) introduce CheckList, a taskagnostic methodology for testing NLP models. With the help of CheckList tool we can create templates that aimed at testing a particular capability or phenomenon. A large number of diverse examples can then be generated from the template and then evaluated upon.
