<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
We invite research papers, discussing the reasoning aspects in natural language
understanding tasks. The papers can be in broad topics including but not limited to the
following topics.
<ul>
	<li>Integration of reasoning and Learning</li>
	<li>Natural Language Logical Reasoning Tasks and Datasets</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Program Synthesis for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Program Synthesis and Deep Learning</li>
	<li>Integrating knowledge using Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation, Relational
	Reasoning)</li>
	<li>Commonsense knowledge and Reasoning</li>
	<li>Applications of Probabilistic Logical Reasoning</li>
	<li>Inference in Knowledge Bases</li>
	<li>Reasoning in Natural Language and X (Computer Vision, Robotics)</li>
</ul>
We also invite 4-page and 2-page length short papers along the shared task theme, which may involve 1) analysis of the shared datasets, 2) extension of CheckList for NLI/NLU for testing different aspects of reasoning (multiple hops, inductive/deductive/abductive and so on), 3) Extended Abstract with a use-case using a neuro-symbolic method, and 4) Demonstration involving finding bugs in reasoning capabilities of NLI/NLU models and enhance with human feedback.
