<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
We invite research papers, discussing the reasoning aspects in natural language
understanding tasks. The papers can be in broad topics including but not limited to the
following topics.
<ul>
	<li>Integration of reasoning and Learning</li>
	<li>Natural Language Logical Reasoning Tasks and Datasets</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Program Synthesis for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Program Synthesis and Deep Learning</li>
	<li>Integrating knowledge using Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation, Relational
	Reasoning)</li>
	<li>Commonsense knowledge and Reasoning</li>
	<li>Applications of Probabilistic Logical Reasoning</li>
	<li>Inference in Knowledge Bases</li>
	<li>Reasoning in Natural Language and X (Computer Vision, Robotics)</li>
</ul>
<em>Shared Resource Theme</em>: In addition to above, we have shared two resources, that we beileve can kick-start the analysis of
different models along specific reasoning dimensions. The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/taxinli/">TaxiNLI</a> dataset is from a recent <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.conll-1.4.pdf">CoNLL 2020</a> work, which introduces a taxonomy of reasoning capabilities. The authors also release a large part of MultiNLI dataset re-annotated with reasoning categories required for inferencing. The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/checklist/">CheckList</a> resource instructs how to create <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">templatad test-suites</a> for different reasoning categories.

<p>We also invite 4-page and 2-page length short papers along the shared task theme, which may involve 1) analysis or extensions of the shared datasets and taxonomy of reasoning, 2) extension of CheckList for NLI/NLU for testing different aspects of reasoning (multiple hops, inductive/deductive/abductive and so on), 3) Extended Abstract with interesting use-cases using a neuro-symbolic method, and 4) demonstration involving finding bugs in reasoning capabilities of NLI/NLU models and enhance with human feedback.</p>
