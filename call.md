<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
We invite 4-page and 2-page length short papers discussing the reasoning aspects in natural language
understanding tasks. The papers can be in broad topics including but not limited to the
following topics.
<ul>
	<li>Integration of reasoning and Learning</li>
	<li>Natural Language Logical Reasoning Tasks and Datasets</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Program Synthesis for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Program Synthesis and Deep Learning</li>
	<li>Integrating knowledge using Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation, Relational
	Reasoning)</li>
	<li>Commonsense knowledge and Reasoning</li>
	<li>Applications of Probabilistic Logical Reasoning</li>
	<li>Inference in Knowledge Bases</li>
	<li>Reasoning in Natural Language and X (Computer Vision, Robotics)</li>
</ul>
<em>Shared Resources</em>: In addition to above, we have shared two resources, that we beileve can help kick-start the analysis of
different models along specific reasoning dimensions. The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/taxinli/">TaxiNLI</a> dataset is from a recent <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.conll-1.4.pdf">CoNLL 2020</a> work, which introduces a taxonomy of 15 reasoning capabilities inspired from first principles of Language and Logic. The authors also released a large part of the MultiNLI dataset re-annotated with reasoning categories required for inferencing. The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/checklist/">CheckList</a> resource instructs how to create <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">templatad test-suites</a> to specifically test different reasoning categories.

<p>We invite short papers along the shared resources theme, which may involve 1) analysis or extensions of the shared datasets and taxonomy of reasoning, 2) extension of CheckList for NLI for testing different aspects of reasoning (multiple hops, inductive/deductive/abductive and so on), 3) Extended Abstract with interesting use-cases using a neuro-symbolic method, and 4) demonstration involving finding bugs in reasoning capabilities of NLI/NLU models and enhance with human feedback.</p>
