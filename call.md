<h2>Call For Papers</h2>

We invite authors to submit <b>short and positional papers in IJCAI double-column</b> format (<a href="https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit">Author's Kit</a>) discussing the reasoning aspects in natural language understanding tasks:
<ul><li> <b>Short papers (maximum 4 pages, excluding references)</b> should discuss a technical contribution or datasets creating/curation/modification related to reasoning aspects in NLU tasks. Short papers discussing technical contributions should include some validation of the idea, but we are not expecting an extensive and bullet-proof analysis; limited analysis is acceptable. Short papers discussing dataset aspects should provide some estimation of how existing methods perform on the new dataset.</li>
<li> <b>Position papers (maximum 2 pages, excluding references)</b> can discuss ideas without evaluation but have to make them concrete and actionable. The impact of the idea should be clear.</li>
</ul>

We seek papers that explore NLU topics on the shared resources which, we believe, can kick-start the analysis of different models along specific reasoning dimensions. The shared resources include:
<ul>
<li> The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/taxinli/">TaxiNLI</a> dataset is from a recent <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.conll-1.4.pdf">CoNLL 2020</a> work, which introduces a taxonomy of 15 reasoning capabilities inspired from first principles of Language and Logic. The authors also released a large part of the MultiNLI dataset re-annotated with reasoning categories required for inferencing. </li>
<li> The <a href="https://nsnli.github.io/checklist/">CheckList</a> resource instructs how to create <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">templated test-suites</a> to specifically test different reasoning categories. </li>
</ul>

The short papers may involve: 
<ul>
<li> analysis or extensions of the shared datasets and taxonomy of reasoning, </li>
<li> extension of CheckList for NLI for testing different aspects of reasoning (multiple hops, inductive/deductive/abductive and so on), </li>
<li> Extended Abstract with interesting use-cases using a neuro-symbolic method, and </li>
<li> A demonstration involving finding bugs in reasoning capabilities of NLI/NLU models and enhance with human feedback. </li>
</ul>
 
<b>The papers do not need to introduce novel technical contributions. We are interested in insights that identify the limitation of neuro-symbolic methods and push the field forward. </b> Applying existing techniques to shared resources would make an interesting submission to this workshop. We are explicitly interested in (1) works that are deemed <em>too simple</em> or <em>too incremental</em> to publish at a conference (we as the organisers donâ€™t agree with this view), and (2) work-in-progress papers that are not fully matured yet. The paper can approach the problem from any of the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>Integration of reasoning and Learning</li>
	<li>Natural Language Logical Reasoning Tasks and Datasets</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Program Synthesis for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Program Synthesis and Deep Learning</li>
	<li>Integrating knowledge using Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation, Relational
	Reasoning)</li>
	<li>Commonsense knowledge and Reasoning</li>
	<li>Applications of Probabilistic Logical Reasoning</li>
	<li>Inference in Knowledge Bases</li>
	<li>Reasoning in Natural Language and X (Computer Vision, Robotics)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
Submissions to the workshop are limited to 4 pages of content (excluding references and appendices). Please note, while making decisions, the reviewers may not consider the appendix content. The submission process is single-blind. 

<b>We are also happy to announce that we are inviting re-submissions from top NLP and AI (ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, IJCAI and AAAI) venues to broaden the coverage of topics. If you would like to present re-submissions, please send your formatted non-anonymized draft directly to nsnli.ijcai21@gmail.com with Title, Abstract, List of Authors, and the name of the Accepted Venue.</b>

All submissions must be in IJCAI double-column format (<a href="https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit">IJCAI 2021 Author's Kit</a>).

Submission link: <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ijcai.org/IJCAI/2021/Workshop/NSNLI">OpenReview Site</a>. 

Please note, accepted papers in this workshop will not be archival in nature (in the sense that we do not wish to publish an official proceedings).
