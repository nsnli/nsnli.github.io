We invite research papers, discussing the reasoning aspects in natural language
understanding tasks. The papers can be in broad topics including but not limited to the
following topics.
<ul>
	<li>Integration of reasoning and Learning</li>
	<li>Natural Language Logical Reasoning Tasks and Datasets</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Neuro-symbolic Program Synthesis for Natural Language</li>
	<li>Program Synthesis and Deep Learning</li>
	<li>Integrating knowledge using Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation, Relational
	Reasoning)</li>
	<li>Commonsense knowledge and Reasoning</li>
	<li>Applications of Probabilistic Logical Reasoning</li>
	<li>Inference in Knowledge Bases</li>
