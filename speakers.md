<h2>Tentative Speakers</h2>

Peter Clark (AI2) is the Senior Research Manager for AI2. His work focuses upon natural
language processing, machine reasoning, and large knowledge bases, and the interplay
between these three areas. He has received several awards including a AAAI Best Paper
(1997), Boeing Associate Technical Fellowship (2004), and AAAI Senior Member (2014). He
received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1991, and has researched these topics for 30
years with more than 80 refereed publications. He recently started exploring Transformersâ€™
abilities to symbolic reasoning with natural language input. Interesting results along this line
inspire the possibility that Transformers can act as a robust reasoning engine.

Kristian Kersting (TU Darmstadt) is a Full Professor (W3) at the Computer Science
Department of the TU Darmstadt University, Germany. He is the head of the Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) lab, a member of the Centre for Cognitive Science,
a faculty of the ELLIS Unit Darmstadt, and the founding co-director of the Hessian Center for
Artificial Intelligence (hessian.ai). After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Freiburg in
2006, he was with the MIT, Fraunhofer IAIS, the University of Bonn, and the TU Dortmund
University. His main research interests are statistical relational artificial intelligence (AI) as
well as deep (probabilistic) programming and learning.

Mohit Bansal (UNC Chapel Hill) is the John R. & Louise S. Parker Associate Professor and
the Director of the MURGe-Lab (in the UNC-NLP Group) in the Computer Science
department at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. Prior to this, he was a
research assistant professor (3-year endowed position) at TTI-Chicago. He received his
Ph.D. in 2013 from the University of California at Berkeley (where he was advised by Dan
Klein) and his B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur in 2008. He has also
spent time at Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Cornell University. His explorations
in Natural Language Inference and the shortcomings of deep learning methods have steered
the direction of research in NLI and natural language understanding.

Samuel Bowman (NYU) is the Assistant Professor of Linguistics, Data Science & Computer
Science in New York University. He studies artificial neural network models for natural
language understanding, with a focus on building high-quality training and evaluation data
and on applying these models to scientific questions in syntax and semantics. His doctoral
dissertation and latter work (SNLI, MNLI, GLUE, SuperGLUE) has been the driving force
behind propelling research in natural language inference and by extension, natural language
understanding.

Lise Getoor (UCSC) is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at UC Santa Cruz
and the director of the UC Santa Cruz D3 Data Science Center. She received her PhD from
Stanford University in 2001, her MS from UC Berkeley, and her BS from UC Santa Barbara,
and was a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park from 2001-2013. Her
research areas include machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty; in addition she
works in data management, visual analytics and social network analysis. She is considered
to be one of the founding members of the field of statistical relational learning.

Ryan Riegel (IBM Research AI) is a researcher in the AI Reasoning group at IBM Research.
He works on neuro-symbolic reasoning methods and their related technologies, including
sound and complete real-valued logic, logically constrained neural network learning,
extensions of said to temporal and modal logic, and applications including natural language
question answering. In the past, he has worked on fast algorithms for a family of
nonparametric machine learning methods dubbed generalized N-Body problems, which
includes all-nearest-neighbors and kernel density estimation. He also co-founded an AI
startup where he oversaw and contributed to the development of enterprise-grade machine
learning software for Big Data. He received a Joint BS in Mathematics and Computer
Science from Harvey Mudd College and a PhD in Computer Science from the Georgia
Institute of Technology.
